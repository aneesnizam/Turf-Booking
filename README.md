## About The Project

Finding and booking a local sports turf can be a fragmented process involving phone calls and uncertain availability. TurfLink aims to solve this by creating a centralized marketplace. Users can search for turfs based on location, sport, and availability, while turf owners get a simple platform to list their venues and manage bookings. This project handles complex features like overnight booking schedules, location-based searching, and user reviews to create a reliable and user-friendly service.
